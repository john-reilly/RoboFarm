## [40 Million Americans](https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/facts) stuggle with food poverty 
## In the [UK  17% of adults](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/31/food-poverty-crisis-government-cost-of-living),at any one time, are concerned about running out of food.
##  [27 % of people in Africa](https://www.worldhunger.org/africa-hunger-poverty-facts-2018/)  are in Food Insecurity


# We need Cheap food!

# Solution?

# RoboFarm

We will use autonomous vehicles and machine learning to develope Robots for agriculture!

Picking fruit, removing weeds, planting seeds

Wherever people struggle to produce food 

Wherever people struggle to afford food

We will bring the technology to make it happen!


# RoboFarm

What we got.....
...well its just me right now but you are welcome to join.

...I have my flower classifer that we will use as the basis of fruit classifcation

...I have my [Self Driving Car Nano Degreee Projects](http://johnreilly.tech/)  (I am in Term 1)

## AND......
I have [hundreds of pictures](https://github.com/john-reilly/RoboFarm/tree/master/Sample%20Apples) and some movies of Apples that I took myself and I will share open source.

Why apples?
....because my Dad has apple trees and we had a lot of apples this year and I thought to myself I wonder
if I can make a robot to pick all these apples?



## Next Steps:

We need to build a great data set!
I have 300 pictures of apples and about the same of parts of trees , leaves etc that are on an apple tree but not an apple.
I also have some high and low resolution video.

* We need to let people know that the dataset is growing and available for reseach and experimentation

* We need to invite students to contribute projects or research time. You are all welcome.

* We need some robot makers

* Want to join?

You are welcome , just remember everything that goes into GitHub is open source.
